# Reportilizer
A really crappy interface for drawing boxes on a page, adding custom HTML/CSS to those boxes, mergin that custom HTML with JSON data using a templating language, and generating a PDF.  

# Development 
`npm run start` to start the react dev server
`npm run electron` to start the electron app

# Production
No idea, haven't gotten that far.
